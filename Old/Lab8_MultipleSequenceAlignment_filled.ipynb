    "The idea is that if a region of a protein is not under selection then the amino acids would be expected to be present in equal frequencies. So if there are positions within homologous protein sequences where only a very few amino acids are regularly observed - given a large enough set of homologous proteins - we presume that amino acids which are absent or observed infrequently are deleterious to the protein's function.    \n",

If you're using the Muscle or MAFFT websites - right click on \"Download Alignment File\", select \"Save Link As . . . \", and save the file to the 'BIOL361_GeneEx5' file which you have generated on your desktop. If you're using the T-Coffee website - right click on \"clustalw_aln file\", select \"Save Link As . . . \", and save the file to the working directory. Do not include spaces in your file name - for example, do not name your file \"aryl hydrocarbon receptor.clw\"; better names are \"aryl _hydrocarbon_receptor.clw\" or \"ArylHydrocarbonReceptor.clw\".\n",
