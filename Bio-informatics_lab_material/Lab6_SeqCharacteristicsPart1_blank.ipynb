      "Next test if the nucleotide composition of your gene differs significantly from the expected equal representation of nucleotides using the chi-square test. Remember that the chi-square test statistic is the sum over all values (here each of the four nucleotides) of the difference between the number of times that nucleotide occurs within your sequence (\"the observed\") and the number of times you would expect to see that nucleotide if the nucleotides occur with equal frequencies (\"the expected\"), squared, divided by the expected. The smaller the difference between the observed and the expected, the smaller the test statistic will be and the less support you have for rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed and expected data come from the same distribution, i.e. are equally distributed. Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, the p-value represents the probability of finding a test statistic equal to or greater than your test statistic by chance. A p-value of 0.05 or less is the generally accepted standard for significance in scientific publications. Where the p-value is less than 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis; if the p-value is greater than 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
